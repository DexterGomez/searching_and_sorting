# Searching and Sorting algorithms

Searching is the process to get the index (or a warning if is not present) of an element in a given group of data that can be ordered or not. Sorting algorithms try to set the order of the elements of a list of data.

Both activies are usually performed to solve many common day problems, computer scientists spend many time doing research to improve or find algorithms to do those activies.

In this repository some algorithms will be explined and implemented in python programming language.
